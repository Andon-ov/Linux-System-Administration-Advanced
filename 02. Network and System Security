Network and System Security 101

1. Kernel Parameters

    Current State of a Running Linux System

    Available via the procfs virtual filesystem mounted at /proc
        There are both read-only and writeable items
        Writable items are in /proc/sys
        Some of the namespaces are kernel, net, etc.
        Information can be found via man 5 proc

    Working with Kernel Variables

        Can be read and written via echo and sysctl
        Persistent configuration is stored in /etc/sysctl.conf or /etc/sysctl
        To apply part or all configuration changes we can use sysctl -p or sysctl --system


2. Resource Limits

    The pam_limits module sets limits on the system resources that can be obtained in a user-session
    They can be either soft or hard
    Can be set for user, group, or everyone
    Include open files, file locks, max number of processes, etc.
    Controlled via the bash built- in ulimit
    Persistent configuration is stored in /etc/security/limits.conf and /etc/security/limits.d/ (files are read in alphabetical order)



3. Access Control Lists
    File Mode (Standard Permissions)
        Permissions are read, write, and execute
        Permissions are for user, group, and others
        Represented in octal and symbolic notation
        Everyday tools include ls, stat, chown, chgrp, and chmod
        Default permissions are configured via umask

    File Mode (Special Permissions)
        Sticky bit Typically, is set on folders chmod o+t /folder
        SGID bit Can be set on folders and files chmod g+s /folder
        SUID bit Usually is set on executable files chmod u+s file.sh

    Access Control Lists
        Overcome file mode limitations, i.e. single user and single group
        Utilities installed via package
        System module loaded during boot process
        Controlled on filesystem level via options when mounting


    Access Control Lists Rules
        setfacl -m [d:]principal:[principal-name:]rights /path/to/object
        Rules can be default (set on folder level) or specific
        Multiple rules can be set simultaneously
        Principal can be user (u), group (g), or others (o)
        Rights are set via symbolic notation and can be r, w, x, -


    Special Access Control Lists

        NFS ACL
            nfs4_getfacl / nfs4_setfacl
            Separate package
            Implemented by the NFS Server and doesn’t rely on the filesystem

        CIFS ACL
            getcifsacl / setcifsacl
            Separate package
            Easier with winbind
            Implemented by the Samba Server and doesn’t rely on the filesystem

    DAC vs MAC
